You remember the coconut crab you picked up earlier, you’re pretty sure throwing it could do some damage.123You’re pretty sure you need something crabby like to throw at him… but… instead you are now matthews dinner.123You hurl the crab at Matthew's head. Your aim is good and he collapses to the floor, unconscious. You're safe. You look up and there is an entrance upwards. Where does it go?123After your unbelivably exhausting fight, you sit down and relax. To your surprise, a bowl of food appears before you and you gobble it down as fast as you can and then you sleep like a baby.123On your west it looks like there might be a path… but it is blocked by overgrown branches. Maybe something can cut it down?
