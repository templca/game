This is your house. South from you is the beach access, and east from you is a path.123You enter a beach with dull sand. Downwards there is a blue sea that stretches out to nowhere. North is back to your house.123You walk along the path. If you look down you see a forest. Westwards is towards your house.123You slowly make your way into the cave. Its extremely dark, and you start to feel pretty scared. A gross smell wafts through the air. Suddenly, Matthew bursts through the cave. You’re so scared the axe crumbles to pieces in your hand. He starts running towards you. ‘HOW DARE YOU DISTURB MY GAMING TIME’ he roars in your face.123You walk into a perfectly picturesque beach with white sand and bright blue water. Big coconut crabs scuttle across the sand. You can go east back to the normal beach.123You enter A deep pine forest. It seems pretty easy to get lost walking through it. Looking to your west there is an old hut. Going south darkens into a cave you haven’t seen before. Going up leads to back to the path 123You splash into the sea. It is icy-cold, so you better go back up to the beach when you’re finished swimming.123You walk into the abandoned hut. This hut was obviously used by old hunters before it was abandoned for some reason. Maybe there is something of use here?123 You walk up into a homely looking room. You realise it is a kitchen.
